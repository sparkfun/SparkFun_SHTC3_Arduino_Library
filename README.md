This Arduino library allows you to take Humidity and Temperature readings using the SHTC3 sensor from Sensirion using the standard Wire (I2C) library built into Arduino. This means the library is compatible with any Arduino-compatible board that has I2C hardware. Key features of the library include the ability to return either raw ADC values or flaoting point values in %RH and deg C/deg F, data validity indicators based on CRC checking, and a unified return status format for easy error checking. For advanced users an on-return callback is implemented to illuminate the order of program execution.
